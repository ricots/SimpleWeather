# SimpleWeather

Simple android weather application show current weather from openweathermap.org 
Just print city name you want to see weather for today. 
Also you can watch this city on google maps by clicking on appropriate menu item. 
This application use Google map API to show correct sunrise and sunset time. 
For better performance you supposed to print City name in format like this :  
London,GB  
Some times openweathermap.org return json without some parameters. Its can be : 
"temp_min", "temp_max" , "sea_level" ,  "grnd_level", "sunrise", "sunset" and others. 
In that case some weather information can be untrue.
